KERNEL – WRO 2026 Future Engineers

About the Team

Kernel is a robotics team competing in the World Robot Olympiad 2026 – Future Engineers category. We are a group of students passionate about engineering, autonomous systems, and real‑world problem‑solving. Our mission is to design a reliable, efficient, and intelligent autonomous vehicle capable of completing the challenges of the competition with a simple mechanic.

- Team Name: Kernel

Each member contributes unique strengths in programming, Electronics, mechanical design, and strategy.

Team Strategy

Our approach is built around a simple but powerful idea:

Simple = Efficiency

We believe that the best engineering solutions are not the most complicated ones, but the ones that work consistently, are easy to maintain, and can be improved quickly.  
Our strategy focuses on:

- Clean mechanical design with minimal failure points  
- Modular and readable code 
- Smart use of sensors instead of excessive hardware  
- Fast iteration cycles for testing and refinement  

Hardware & Technology

Our autonomous vehicle is built using modern embedded systems and custom‑designed components.

Processing Unit
- Raspberry Pi 4 
  - Runs the main control software  
  - Handles sensor fusion, navigation logic, and computer vision  
  - Programmed entirely in Python
 
Build Hat
  -Controls Spike Prime's Engines

Sensors
- ToF (Time‑of‑Flight) Sensors
  - High‑precision distance measurement  
  - Used for obstacle detection and proximity control  

- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
  - Provides orientation, acceleration, and angular velocity  
  - Essential for stabilization and trajectory correction  

- Arducam Camera Module  
  - Real‑time computer vision  
  - Line detection, object recognition, and environmental awareness  

Mechanical Design
- 3D‑printed components using an AD5X printer
  - Custom sensor mounts  
  - Camera brackets  
  - Chassis parts and structural reinforcements  
  - Rapid prototyping for continuous improvement  

Software Architecture

Our software is written in Python and organized into modular subsystems:

- Perception Layer
  - Reads data from ToF, IMU, and camera  
  - Pre‑processing and filtering  

- Sensor Fusion 
  - Combines multiple sensor inputs for accurate state estimation  

- Navigation & Path Planning
  - Determines speed, direction, and maneuvers  
  - Implements obstacle avoidance and route optimization  

- Control System
  - Sends commands to motors and actuators  
  - Ensures smooth and stable movement  

The architecture is designed to be scalable, easy to debug, and competition‑ready.
